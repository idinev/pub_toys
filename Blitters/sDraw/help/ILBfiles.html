<h1>ILB files/data</h1>
<h4>What are ILB files?</h4>
<p>
An .ILB file (introduced in sDraw) is a compressed .bmp (without alpha-channel) or .tga (with alpha-channel). The compression is a bit lossy, since it initially crunches RGB888 (24-bit color) into RGB565 (16-bit color). The alpha channel stays intact (8-bit), if present.  <BR>
Currently in sDraw, ILB files are mostly useful for images that have alpha-channel.

<h4>Making .ilb files/libs </h4>
&bull; <B>To a file:</b> Drag-drop a .bmp or .tga file over PackToILB.exe<BR>
&bull; <B>To a .lib:</b> Drag-drop a .bmp or .tga file over PackBitmap.exe. You need the MASM32 package, otherwise PackBitmap will crash. <BR>
.bmp files must be 24bpp<BR>
.tga files must be 32bpp without RLE compression, origin at top-left.
