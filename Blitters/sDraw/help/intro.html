<h1>Introduction to sDraw</h1>
Version 1.1: July 16, 2006. <br>
Version 1.2: January 13, 2007.<br>
<h4>What is sDraw?</h4>
<p> A GDI replacement in some aspects, an upgrade in others, and a
convenient library in all cases. All drawing/blending is done in
software on one back-buffer DIB or on a custom surface (bitmap in
memory). All drawing/blending is internally clipped (by one rectangle,
any more would slow-down drawing). The final result is BitBlt-ed from
the back-buffer DIB onto the window DC. </p>
<h4>Features</h4>
<p> &#8226; Loading and management of bitmaps is easy and straightforward. <br>
&#8226; No need for brushes, pens, DCs, hBitmaps<br>
&#8226; supports images with alpha-channel<br>
&#8226; alpha-blending, additive-blending, custom blending, transparency-Blt<br>
&#8226; 12 ROPs (raster operations) for drawing<br>
&#8226; clipping - useful for complex GUI<br>
&#8226; preprocessing of bitmaps: Color-to-Alpha, Premultiply-Alpha<br>
&#8226; speed - completely written and optimized in x86 assembler<br>
&#8226; interoperability with GDI, DirectDraw and Direct3D. <br>
</p>
<h4>Lacks:</h4>
&#8226; On nVidia videocards, the final BitBlt fucks up and decreases
performance (but not enough to throw sDraw into the Void of the Recycle
Bin). Maybe the beta-testers had driver problems? ATi R9200, ATi R9250
and GeForce2 work perfectly (meaning 0.5% cpu usage at 30-50 fps forced
update-rate, instead of FX5900's 45% cpu load). <br>
&#8226; not opensource.
<br>
sDraw can be <b>linked statically</b> (sDraw.lib) in C/C++/asm apps,
or dynamically (sDraw.dll) in VisualBasic apps.

code useful, even if the coding itself was fun (~3000 lines for 1 day,
but all this hateful documentation for two days ^^")
